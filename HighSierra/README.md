### Notes

* Enoch bootloader is not used for macOS High Sierra. Clover is used instead.


### Host System Details

Known to work on:

* Fedora 26/27 running on Ryzen 7 1800X CPU.

* Fedora 27 running on i7-6600U CPU.

* Fedora 27 running on i7-5820K CPU.

* Ubuntu 18.04 running on i5-6500 and i7-8750H CPUs.

* Gentoo (October-2017) running on AMD FX-8320 CPU with AMD RX 470 GPU
  passthrough.

* Arch Linux (February-2018) on i7-6700HQ CPU.

Tested with QEMU >= 2.12 (QEMU 3.0 works too) and Linux Kernel >= 4.10. A CPU
with SSE4.1 support is required for macOS High Sierra. Intel VT-x / AMD SVM is
required.


### Installation Preparation

#### Preparation steps on your current macOS installation

* Download macOS High Sierra installer from Apple App Store.

  If you are getting a partial installer from the Apple App Store, [follow the instructions here](http://osxdaily.com/2017/09/27/download-complete-macos-high-sierra-installer/) to get the full (5GB) version instead.

* Clone this repository. Files included in this repository are needed for ISO
  creation.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM.git
  ```

* Run the ISO creation script `create_iso_highsierra.sh` included in this
  folder. Run it with `sudo`.

* Copy the generated ISO image from your Mac's Desktop to your QEMU/KVM machine.

#### Preparation steps on your QEMU system

* Clone this repository again on your QEMU system. Files from this repository are used in the following steps.

* Install required software packages.

  ```
  sudo apt-get install qemu uml-utilities libguestfs-tools
  ```

* For QEMU versions < 2.10.1, build and use QEMU from source. See http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Hosts/Linux for
  more help. QEMU 2.10.1 in Fedora 27, QEMU 2.11.1 in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and QEMU 2.11 in Arch Linux already work fine.

  ```
  # First edit /etc/apt/sources.list to add/uncomment deb-src lines

  sudo apt-get update

  sudo apt-get build-dep qemu

  git clone https://github.com/kholia/qemu.git

  cd qemu

  git checkout macOS

  git submodule init

  git submodule update --recursive

  ./configure --prefix=/home/$(whoami)/QEMU --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --audio-drv-list=pa

  $ make clean; make -j8; make install
  ```

* See [networking notes](../networking-qemu-kvm-howto.txt) to setup guest networking.
  * Note: The repository version of the `boot-macOS-HS.sh` script is configured
    to use ['tap' networking](../networking-qemu-kvm-howto.txt#L28) - change
    networking style and the boot script if your needs are different.

* Create a virtual HDD image where macOS will be installed.

  ```
  qemu-img create -f qcow2 mac_hdd.img 128G
  ```

* Create bootable Clover disk.

  Edit `clover/config.plist.stripped.qemu` and set the desired screen resolution (default is 1024x768).

  ```
  sudo ./clover-image.sh --iso Clover-v2.4k-4644-X64.iso --cfg clover/config.plist.stripped.qemu --img Clover.qcow2
  ```

  This command only works on a Fedora (>= 27) host machine.

  Instead of building your own bootable Clover disk, you may use the included
  `Clover.qcow2` disk image, which offers 1024x768 screen resolution.


### Installation

To install macOS High Sierra, use the included `boot-macOS-HS.sh` script.

Note: Ensure that the OVMF resolution is set equal to resolution set in your
`Clover.qcow2` file (default is 1024x768). This can be done via the OVMF menu,
which you can reach with a press of the ESC button during the OVMF boot logo
(before Clover boot screen appears). In the OVMF menu settings, set Device
Manager -> OVMF Platform Configuration -> Change Preferred Resolution for Next
Boot to the desired value (default is 1024x768). Commit changes and exit the
OVMF menu. Relaunch the `boot-macOS-HS.sh` script.

#### Installer Steps

* After booting, the initial language selection should show up.

* After selecting the language, select Disk Utility and erase your target disk.

  In some cases if the target disk doesn't appear in the Disk Utility, then
  fire-up the Terminal program and prepare the hard drive for installation
  manually.

  ```
  diskutil list
  diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ macOS disk0  # adapt this according to your system
  ```

  High Sierra's (< 10.13.3) Disk Utility does not recognize unformatted disks,
  unless you click View > Show All Devices, quit Disk Utility, then relaunch it.

  Thanks to https://tinyapps.org/blog/mac/ and xenadu02 for this tip.

* When done, quit Terminal.

* Now, you can continue with the installation as usual.

* When finished, the VM will reboot automatically and the first time setup continues as usual.

#### Post-Installation Recommendations

* Install Clover to the main hard drive where macOS High Sierra was installed
  in previous steps. See [UEFI notes](../UEFI/README.md) for details.

* For debugging and general tips, see the main [README.md](../README.md) file
  and [notes.md](../notes.md) file.

* For USB and GPU passthrough notes, see [UEFI notes](../UEFI/README.md) file.
